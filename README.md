# Diabetes-Prediction-using-SVM

# Overview
This project implements a diabetes prediction system using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. The system takes input features related to diabetes, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI, and predicts whether a person is diabetic or not.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Pima Indians Diabetes Database," which contains various health-related features and an outcome variable indicating whether a person has diabetes.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
